## ⚠️ Important Notes

🔹 This extension works **best on individual job pages from company websites**.  
🔹 It does **not support job boards** like **LinkedIn**, **Indeed**, **Glassdoor**, **StepStone**, etc.  
🔹 Make sure to **open the full job listing**, not just a preview side panel.

📸 Here's an example of a job preview that won't work — avoid this view:

✅ Click the job to fully open the job description page in order for the extension to work properly.
